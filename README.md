ABSTRACT
This paper presents a comprehensive examination of the accessibility of operating systems for users with disabilities, focusing on individuals affected by visual, auditory, and motor impairments. In the context of growing reliance on digital technologies, ensuring equitable access to computing environments is critical. The study reviews the challenges faced by these users in interacting with operating systems and evaluates existing assistive technologies and solutions designed to address these challenges.
Through an analysis of major operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, the paper evaluates current accessibility features, assessing their effectiveness and limitations. Research studies on the usability of these features for users with various types of impairments provide insights into their experiences and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, the paper explores the common challenges across different disabilities, highlights technological barriers, and discusses potential solutions.
Case studies and best practices are presented to illustrate successful strategies in enhancing operating system accessibility. Recommendations for future improvements include the development of more inclusive features and better integration of assistive technologies. The paper concludes with a discussion on the social and policy implications of accessibility, and envisions a future where operating systems provide seamless, intuitive, and inclusive experiences for all users, regardless of their abilities.
